# django-crmapp

At the heart of this course is the CRM Easy application. You can access the full application at http://crmeasyapp.com.

To use the CRM Easy application, open the link above and then click on one of the sign up buttons to create a user account. I recommend you take some time to study each page of the application.

The key theme of the project, is to practise how to build a SaaS application. In addition to the application itself, you will learn how to build a marketing page, and process payments. The project has these distinct parts:

* A home page used for marketing
* An order form that connects to a credit card processing provider
* A page that displays paginated lists of content that is searchable
* An AJAX powered page that allows for basic CRUD operations
